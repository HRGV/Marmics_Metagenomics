From samples to genomes to ecophysioloy

The course covers next generation sequence analysis using illumina sequenced metagenomic and metatranscriptomic samples. We walk you through a workflow of quality control, assembly, binning, annotation and expression analysis focussing on thiotrophic ectosymbionts of marine nematodes.
